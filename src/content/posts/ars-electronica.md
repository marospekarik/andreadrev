In 2022, I worked as a project manager for the world’s largest media art festival, at the intersection of technology, humanity, sustainability, and innovation. 
I had the chance to produce the theme exhibition Ars Electronica Gardens, with the festival’s international partners, institutions such as Media Art Festival Japan, Leonardo, IMPAKT, V2_Lab for Unstable Media, The New Real Observatory, and many more.

I mediated the cross-sector communication, liaising with the technical, marketing, and curatorial teams in producing an exhibition with globally dispersed institutions with technically challenging artworks: interactive installations, kinetic sculptures, VR, AR, and multisensorial performance.
