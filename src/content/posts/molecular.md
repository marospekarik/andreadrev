Art-science project, with Artificial Life in wetware. Protocells making music, essentially. Molecular Theatre is a media art project in collaboration with the artist Maros Pekarik. In the work, we explore the life-like behaviors and agency of non-living, yet animate forms of primitive yet ancient, protocells, that some scientists believe are the origin of life on Earth. 

Using data sonification, we gave them a voice with which they performed various compositions. The artwork was shown at the exhibition Alchemy of Knowledge: Transdisciplinary Entanglements of Artificial Biology, Robotics, and Art at Art Quarter Budapest.
