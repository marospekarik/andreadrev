While studying transdisciplinary humanities at the Faculty of Media and Communication in Belgrade, I was intrigued by curating digital and non-human art, and by the emerging social media-based art projects. To further investigate this topic, I curated and produced an exhibition, Instatutuon, in which I exhibited Instagram posts in an art gallery, to analyze how this social media content behaves in different contexts: one of a social media, and another of an art gallery.
