While I was a student, I was into analog photography. Inspired by the massive brain drain from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with people leaving for a better economic future after the first massive emigration during the Yugoslav wars in the 90s, I did a photo series Duh Tuzle (The ghost of Tuzla) shot in my hometown of Tuzla. It was presented at a solo exhibition.
