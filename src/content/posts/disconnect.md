While studying in Poland, I co-produced and co-curated the media art festival (dis)Connect, which unpacked the topics of post-colonial heritage, technologically-mediated performance art, and non-human performance. Spread over 3 days at Art Inkubator Lodz, (dis)Connect displayed the unusual collaborations between nature and technology, human and non-human, and material and immaterial.
