I founded and creatively directed the Belgrade-based music event enterprise Nocne More, featuring live electronic music and DJs. Throughout the years, we produced a series of concerts and events with live electronic artists, usually playing synth, darkwave, and ambient music. 

The idea came from a fascination with live electronic music, the magic that happens when such complex electronic compositions emerge live in front of the audience. Some artists performing at Nocne More are Neon Lies, YusYus, Flesh Community, Donna Harringwey, Filmmaker, Broken English Club, Molchat Doma, and others.
