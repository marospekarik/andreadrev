Post-photography work, shown in Badland Magazine. Even before hybrid teams and the explosion of long-distance relationships, I maintained my vital friendships via Skype and such, as all my friends lived in different cities. The Berlin-based Badland Magazine commissioned the work P2P (Peer-to-peer) which I shot via webcam/screengrab in a post-photography style, followed by poetry derived from online chats.
