Kinder Inc. is a video artwork created by assemblages of archive footage and open-source commercial clips, using design-thinking methodology. The posthuman theoretical framework allows for fusing topics of reproduction, capitalism, feminism, and technology, through Donna Haraway's notions of the cyborg and kinship. It is an intersectional analysis of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) e.g. surrogacy, sperm donation, egg donation, IVF, and such techniques of technologically mediating reproduction, critically researching the consequent systems of power and monetization, and the colonial echoes within ART as an economic practice. Shown at Politics of Machines 2022 at Aalborg University (DK).

Artists/Researchers: Andrea Tesanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Joy Panaligan (Phillipines), Cece Manzano (El Salvador), Diana Monroy Garcia (Colombia), and Buted Oyunbileg (Mongolia).
