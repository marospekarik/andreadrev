In 2021, I collaborated with UN Women B&H on a podcast of 25 episodes following the red thread of patriarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina—through the lens of gender rights, culture, sustainable development goals, and beyond.


It was a true 360° experience. I conducted research, interviewed the guests, produced the filming, and did the final touches on the audio/video editing. The podcast reached an audience of a few thousand viewers and was distributed on a large local cable TV Telemach EON.
