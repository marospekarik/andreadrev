In 2021, I collaborated with UN Women B&H on a podcast of 25 episodes following the red thread of patriarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina—through the lens of gender rights, culture, sustainability efforts, and beyond.

I produced and hosted the podcast, facilitating interviews with decision-makers, scientists, humanities theoreticians, sustainability advocates, and beyond. I love podcasts – both hosting and production. It was a true 360 experience for me, as I conducted research, produced, interviewed the guests, and did the final touches on the design and audio/video editing. The podcast reached an audience of a few thousand viewers and was distributed on a large local cable TV Telemach EON.
