I co-founded and creatively directed the multimedia platform for alternative culture: Hali Gali. It is a Belgrade-based music festival with a publishing enterprise â€” we published two music compilations and numerous print editions (Hali Gali Fanzin, Hali Gali Newspaper). 

What started as a grassroots project to revive and support the local alternative and indie music scene, evolved into a staple organization in the region, with thousands of event visitors, organizers speaking at European music conferences, and a thriving Hali Gali scene. Nowadays, it is an ambition of every young band in Serbia to publish for or play at Hali Gali.
