<h1>Hi, I am ANDREA DREV </br>(fka TEŠANOVIĆ)</h1>
<h2>communications manager and creative director based in Copenhagen.</h2>
</header>

I work at the nexus of business and creativity, elevating brands through impactful campaigns and multimedia content. Communications are a multi-sensory and multi-channel experience. Therefore, I keep design, aesthetics, storytelling, strategy, and digital media expertise in my toolkit. I build brands, craft their narratives, and nurture them daily. My work is driven by a desire to build bridges between organizations and audiences.

I co-founded the [HALI GALI](/posts/hali-gali) entertainment platform, creative production [Gilipter](/posts/gilipter), and the feminist podcast [FEMKAST](/posts/femkast).

Recently, I worked with [Dimension Lab](https://www.dimensionlab.org/), the [United Nations](https://un.dk/), [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/) and [Drugstore Belgrade](https://drugstorebeograd.com/).
