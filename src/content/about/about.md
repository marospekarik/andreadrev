Hi, I am Andrea Drev (ex. Tesanovic), a **creative director**, **producer**, and **communications professional** based in *Copenhagen*.

Growing up in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I studied **multimedia production**, focusing on **creative direction**, **marketing**, and **project management**. Later on, I moved to Belgrade (Serbia) where I mostly worked as a freelance producer and communications specialist. I finished my master’s studies in **Media Art** in 2023, with a joint degree from universities in Austria, Poland, Denmark, and Singapore. In my master’s, I researched interactive arts, robotics, artificial intelligence, and project management in arts and culture, mainly in intersectional, multi-cultural projects.

When I was little, I wanted to be a designer, direct films, and be a businesswoman — to merge these interests, I opted for a career in production. Life took me into project management, **digital marketing**, and **corporate communications**. I work at the nexus of elevating brands and expanding organizations through impactful projects, campaigns, and visual content. I believe communications are a multi-sensory and multi-channel experience, therefore in my toolkit, I keep **design**, **aesthetics**, **strategy**, **storytelling**, and **branding**. No matter what type of project I direct and produce, it is driven by a desire to build bridges between brands/organizations and audiences/customers.

I co-founded the [HALI GALI](/posts/hali-gali) entertainment platform, creative production [Gilipter](/posts/gilipter), and the feminist podcast [FEMKAST](/posts/femkast) in collaboration with UN Women. I worked with [Drugstore Belgrade](https://drugstorebeograd.com/), [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/), and the [United Nations City Copenhagen](https://un.dk/).
